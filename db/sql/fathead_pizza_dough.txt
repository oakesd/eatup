'Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Line a baking sheet or pizza pan with parchment paper. Mix flour and eggs in a large bowl or food processor. Melt mozzarella and cream cheese together in a medium bowl (90-120 seconds in the microwave, or on the stove in a double-boiler if preferred). Mix warm cheese into flour mixture until uniform (by hand, with hand mixer, or in food processor). Spread dough to desired size and thickness on a pizza pan lined with parchment paper (by hand or with rolling pin). Poke holes throughout crust with a fork to prevent air bubbles. Bake in oven until lightly browned (about 6-8 minutes). To make pizza, add desired toppings and return to oven for another 8-10 minutes.' AS instructions,
